Island Lives book ingest workflow

Part of the Islandora project

This set of scripts was created to trannsform scanned books, in the form of directories of TIFF images, into complete sets of book and page objects in a Fedora Commons repository.

Most of the enviornment settings can be altered by modifying the variables in ilives_environment.sh.

If you don't have access to an ABBYY Finereader installation you will need ot replace the OCR section with your own solution.

The GATE+ANNIE workflow is based on a custom set of configurations specific to our Island Lives collection.  This will need to be modified or replaced to suit your needs.

Running the script

First set up ilives_environment.sh so that the STORAGEROOT directory points to where your scans will sit waiting to be ingested.

Copy the content of ilives_environment.sh.example to ilives_environment.sh. We tend to create different files for different repositories, and just rename the one we want to ilives_environment.sh for the ingest task.

The script expects to connect to an Evergreen catalogue. Again, you wil lneed ot modify this to get it to grab bib data from elsewhere.

The script is invoked by running
ilives_process_scans.sh <bibnum> <pid>

Where bibnum is the directory underneath $STORAGEROOT where the TIFFs will be found. Right now tey also need to be under a directory called 'processed' below the bibnum directory.
